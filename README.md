# Java Programs Collection

## Overview
This repository contains multiple Java programs that solve fundamental programming problems, including mathematical computations, condition checking, and array manipulations. These programs take user input and provide accurate results based on standard formulas and algorithms.

## List of Programs

### 1. Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Converts a temperature value from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula:  
  **Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9**

### 2. Check if a Year is a Leap Year
- Determines whether a given year is a leap year using the standard leap year conditions.

### 3. Evaluate the Series: 1 + 3² + 5² + ... up to n terms
- Calculates the sum of squares of the first n odd numbers.

### 4. Evaluate the Series: 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... up to n terms
- Computes a series where numbers alternate between addition and subtraction.

### 5. Find the Factorial of a Number
- Computes the factorial of a given number using an iterative approach.

### 6. Find the Power for a Given Base and Exponent
- Computes the power of a base raised to an exponent without using built-in functions.

### 7. Find the Bangla Season from a Given Month
- Determines the Bangla season based on the input month using a switch-case statement.

### 8. Find the Largest Number in an Array
- Takes an array of numbers as input and finds the largest number using iteration.

### 9. Sort Numbers in Ascending Order
- Sorts an array of numbers using Java’s built-in sorting function.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
